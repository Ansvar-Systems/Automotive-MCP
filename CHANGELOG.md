## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- `sources.yml` data provenance documentation for all data sources
- Golden contract tests (`fixtures/golden-tests.json`) with 15 data accuracy tests
- Drift detection hashes (`fixtures/golden-hashes.json`) for seed data integrity
- `db_metadata` table in SQLite schema (schema_version, built_at, server_version)
- `about` tool listed in `server.json` and `manifest.json` (was implemented but undocumented)
- Security scanning: Semgrep SAST, Trivy vulnerability scan, Socket supply chain, OSSF Scorecard
- Database connectivity check in health endpoints (returns 503 when DB unavailable)
- Version field in Vercel health endpoint response

### Fixed
- Hardcoded version strings in `api/mcp.ts` now read dynamically from `package.json`
- Division by zero in `export_compliance_matrix` markdown generator when total requirements is 0
- `__dirname` undefined in `tests/r155-r156-completeness.test.ts` (ESM without `fileURLToPath`)
- `better-sqlite3` now explicitly declared in `devDependencies` for build script and tests
- Dockerfile removed stale `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` (runtime uses `@ansvar/mcp-sqlite` WASM)
