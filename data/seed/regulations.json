The same indexing has been referenced in the tables in Parts B and C to link each of the attack/vulnerability with a list of corresponding mitigation measures.\n\nThe high-level vulnerability and its corresponding examples have been indexed in Part A. The same indexing has been referenced in the tables in Parts B and C to link each of the attack/vulnerability with a list of corresponding mitigation measures.\n\n4.\n\nThe threat analysis shall also consider possible attack impacts. These may help ascertain the severity of a risk and identify additional risks. Possible attack impacts may include:\n\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\nSafe operation of vehicle affected;\n\nSafe operation of vehicle affected;\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\nVehicle functions stop working;\n\nVehicle functions stop working;\n\n(c)\n\n(c)\n\nSoftware modified, performance altered;\n\nSoftware modified, performance altered;\n\n(d)\n\n(d)\n\nSoftware altered but no operational effects;\n\nSoftware altered but no operational effects;\n\n(e)\n\n(e)\n\nData integrity breach;\n\nData integrity breach;\n\n(f)\n\n(f)\n\nData confidentiality breach;\n\nData confidentiality breach;\n\n(g)\n\n(g)\n\nLoss of data availability;\n\nLoss of data availability;\n\n(h)\n\n(h)\n\nOther, including criminality.\n\nOther, including criminality.\n\nPart A.
